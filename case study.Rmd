## Brainstorm questions

* max and min price?
  * average price?
  * factors affect price?
* Where are prices going up and down over time?
* Relationship between number of reviews and average review?
* Does room type affect availability?
* Location of the unit?
  * what areas are popular?
  * popularity = numbers of units? average price?
* Are there repeat hosts?
  *If so, what does the mean?
