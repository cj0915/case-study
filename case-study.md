## Brainstorm questions

- max and min price?
  - average price?
  - factors affect price?
- Where are prices going up and down over time?
- Relationship between number of reviews and average review?
- Does room type affect availability?
- Location of the unit?
  - what areas are popular?
  - popularity = numbers of units? average price?
- Are there repeat hosts? \*If so, what does the mean?
